[open-source](https://github.com/GSA/touchpoints)

### Is the feedback anonymous?

All public-provided feedback is anonymous. The website does not ask for any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and cannot be used to identify an individual person.  The government agencies participating in the pilot will only use public-provided feedback to improve their customer service.

### Are citizens mandated to provide feedback?

No, feedback is purely optional.  The Touchpoints application website do not prompt for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and cannot be used to identify an individual citizen.   The government agencies participating in the pilot will only use citizen-provided feedback to improve their customer service.

### How will the feedback collected be used?

The government agencies participating in the pilot will only use public-provided feedback to improve their customer service. GSA will partner with agencies to analyze the data and to develop action plans to improve customer service.

### Will the feedback data be open to the general public?

During the pilot phase, the feedback data will only be available to GSA staff participating in this pilot, participating frontline supervisors, and other relevant staff determined by the agency.  If the pilot is successful, we plan to eventually make the citizen feedback data available to the general public.

### What languages are available for the public to submit feedback?

English is the only language available at this time.

## Program History

### What are the origins of the Feedback program?

The pilot was scheduled to last for approximately one (1) calendar year beginning July 2015.
The pilot consisted of four (4) three (3) month phases.

Participating agencies included:

The U.S. Department of State (DOS), The United States Social Security Administration (SSA), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are participating in this pilot.

The DOS pilot collected feedback from citizens visiting passport facilities to receive passports or visa support services. The SSA pilot collected feedback from citizens visiting card centers to receive social security card support services.  The TSA pilot collected transactional feedback from citizens passing through TSA security screening checkpoints at Reagan National Airport (DCA), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and San Francisco International Airport (SFO).

In 2016 and 2018, the Feedback Program became staffed full-time,
chartered to strategically support Customer Experience initiatives.
