### What is the Feedback USA Pilot?

As part of the Customer Service Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goal, established in 2014 and led by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Social Security Administration (SSA), four key priorities were highlighted: improving transactions with government, establishing a community of practice to share best practices and create government-wide standards, increasing feedback and transparency, and focusing on the frontline.

The Feedback USA pilot is intended to support this CAP goal by increasing feedback and transparency.  This pilot will gather transactional data from citizens interacting with the government and share that data with agencies in real-time so they can use the feedback to improve program delivery.
How long is this pilot?

The pilot is scheduled to last for approximately one (1) calendar year beginning July 2015.  The pilot will consist of four (4) three (3) month phases.
What other agencies are participating?

The U.S. Department of State (DOS), The United States Social Security Administration (SSA), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are participating in this pilot.

The DOS pilot will collect feedback from citizens visiting passport facilities to receive passports or visa support services.   The SSA pilot will collect feedback from citizens visiting card centers to receive social security card support services.  The TSA pilot will collect transactional feedback from citizens passing through TSA security screening checkpoints at Reagan National Airport (DCA), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and San Francisco International Airport (SFO).


### How does the public submit feedback?

The public has the option to submit feedback in-person via a kiosk and online via a mobile-friendly website.  The feedback collected is anonymous; it does not contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and cannot be used to identify an individual citizen.


### How does the public submit feedback on a kiosk?

The kiosk will display a single, simple question such as, “How was your experience today?” and provide the public with the option of answering via four color-coded buttons with faces ranging from very unhappy to very happy.  The public has the ability to press one (1) button to provide their feedback; the feedback is complete after the button is selected once.  The kiosks will time-stamp every transaction and push data hourly to GSA’s data warehouse, Salesforce.  Each agency will select the question(s) it asks and questions are displayed via signage that slides into the kiosk holder.  Agencies have the option to change the question at an intermittent frequency.

No one is required to provide feedback.  The feedback collected by the kiosk and the website is anonymous; it does not contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and cannot be used to identify an individual citizen.

### How does the public submit online feedback?

The public can submit online feedback via a URL that will be posted in the regional and field offices.  Signage located at the designated locations will direct the public to a URL, such as feedback.usa.gov/TSA, where they will be able to use their mobile phones to enter the URL, select their servicing location, and provide additional information through a few questions and a verbatim comment box.  The public will  have the option to provide text feedback on each question.  The website does not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and cannot be used to identify an individual citizen.

### What languages are available for the public to submit feedback?

English is the only language available at this time.

### Are citizens mandated to provide feedback?

No, feedback is purely optional.  The Feedback USA kiosk and website do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and cannot be used to identify an individual citizen.   The government agencies participating in the pilot will only use citizen-provided feedback to improve their customer service.

### Is the feedback anonymous?

All public-provided feedback (via kiosk and website) is anonymous. The kiosk and website do not ask for any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and cannot be used to identify an individual person.  The government agencies participating in the pilot will only use public-provided feedback to improve their customer service.

### How will the feedback collected be used?

The government agencies participating in the pilot will only use public-provided feedback to improve their customer service. GSA will partner with agencies to analyze the data and to develop action plans to improve customer service.

### Will the feedback data be open to the general public?

During the pilot phase, the feedback data will only be available to GSA staff participating in this pilot, participating frontline supervisors, and other relevant staff determined by the agency.  If the pilot is successful, we plan to eventually make the citizen feedback data available to the general public.
