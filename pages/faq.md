### What is Touchpoints?

### Is the feedback anonymous?

Under guidance from 2018 A-11 Circular, High Impact Service Providers (HISPs) participating in the Customer Experience Cross Agency Priority Goal, part of the President's Management Agenda, anonymous customer experience scores will be aggregated at the service level and publicly available at [performance.gov/cx](https://performance.gov/cx).
