[open-source](https://github.com/GSA/touchpoints)

### Is the feedback anonymous?

Touchpoints forms that do not ask for any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) cannot be used to identify an individual.


### Are members of the public required to provide feedback?

Submitting feedback is purely optional.

### How will the feedback collected be used?

The government agencies participating in the program will only use your feedback to improve their service delivery. GSA will partner with agencies to analyze the data and develop action plans to help improve customer experience.

### Who can see my feedback?

Feedback submitted via Touchpoints is accessible by the authorized staff of participating agencies.
Under guidance from 2018 A-11 Circular, High Impact Service Providers (HISPs) participating in the Customer Experience Cross Agency Priority Goal, part of the President's Management Agenda, collect anonymous customer experience scores that are aggregated at the service level and publicly available at [performance.gov/cx](https://performance.gov/cx).

### What languages are available for the public to submit feedback?

English is the only language available at this time.
