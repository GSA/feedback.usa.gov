The Feedback Analytics Program develops and manages government-wide services that collect and report quantitative and qualitative customer feedback to aid service improvement and decision-making. This includes establishing methods to evaluate progress toward achieving goals, and supporting continuous, iterative improvements to service design and delivery.
