      <h3>Designing</h3>
      <p>
        Processes exist. At some point, they were designed.
        Explicitly via workflow, service design, or organizational mapping.
        Or, implicitly, via organic growth.
        And likely, a bit of both.
        Understanding WHO does WHAT and WHEN, with context of WHY shapes the landscape of
        an organization.

      <h3>Enacting</h3>
      <p>
        Design Processes are like writing a music score.
        Enacting a Service Design process is like bringing that score to life
        as an orchestra.
        Coordinating and communicating with each staff person involved,
        sharing the score; the Service Maps; co-designing together.

      <h3>Monitoring</h3>
      <p>
        How is a Service performing?
        What defines the Performance for a given Service?
        We help agencies build the proper speedometers
        so they can tune and optimize their programs.
        Part of that gathering all feedback and
        assimilating that which supports the intent
        and mission of the service.
